Repo for analyzing population and meat consumption
- The problem you decided to investigate
	- How much of the US population is vegetarian? Has it increased or remained? (KL: Increase)
	- Has the increase rate of meat consumption in the US surpass the growth rate of US population? (KL: Yes) By type?
	- For the increasing meat consumption, have more livestock been slaughtered or only more weights been processed? (KL: by 1990 more weights after 2000 more livestock) By type?

	- Combine the population data and Livestock and Meat Domestic Data from US Department of Agriculture 
- The results of your analysis, including how your visualizations are relevant and useful
- Suggestions for future research (including improvements to what you did)
	- Predict the C02 emissions from the numbers of livestock
